aXplorience
===========

aXplorience is an R&D C++ application aiming at unveiling the full potential of
native (C/C++) development on Android. The range of covered functionalities
notably includes OpenGL Augmented Reality, Bluetooth networking, and lock-free
inter-thread communication.

NClozer
=======

NClozer is an embedded framework aiming at developing native (C/C++) 
applications for multiple platforms (Android, iOS, WP, ...) with native (Java,
Objective-C, C#, ...) GUI.

NClozer for Android uses the JNI (Java-Native Interface) framework and showcases
a cross-language double-dispatch design pattern. The framework allows your C/C++
application to program native Android Bluetooth, Geolocation, Camera, and 
Widgets, using a C++ API with the same types and signatures as in the Android
Java API. 

Future development
==================

NClozer for iOS, and NClozer for Windows Phone, are under study.
