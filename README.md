aXplorience
===========

aXplorience is a R&D C++ application aiming at unveiling the full potential of 
native (C/C++) development on Android. The range of covered functionnalities
notably includes bluetooth networking, OpenGL Augmented Reality, and lock-free 
inter-thread communication.

NClozer
===========

NClozer is an emmbedded framework aiming at developing native (C/C++) applications for 
multiple plateforms (Android, iOS, WP, ...) with native GUI (Java, Objective-C, C#, ...). 

NClozer for Android uses the JNI (Java-Native Interface) framework and a double dispatch 
design pattern to allow your C/C++ application to programm notably Android Layouts and Widgets. 
The range of covered functionnalities includes programming Android Layout and Widgets in C++ 
using the same class names and function signatures as in the Java SDK.

The aXplorience C++ application is based on the NClozer framework for Android.
